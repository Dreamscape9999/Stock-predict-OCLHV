# Stock-predict-OCLHV
predict the open close low high and volume of stocks
input the data of K of current, predict the K of next three days
print base RMSE and RMSE of each open close low high and volume of forecasts
draw candle sticks of actual and forecast of next day, because I see the RMSE of next day is better than next second day and next third day, so just draw candle stick of forecast of next day to compare the actual we can have a gerenal idea of the performance of the model
the model is not perfect, let's make it perfect together!
if you the model help you please click the star!
and thanks Jason Brownlee, I learn much from his post!
